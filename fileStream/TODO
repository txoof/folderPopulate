Welcome to the portfolio creator for Google Team Drive version 18.05.09-2104
This program will create portfolio folders in Google Team Drive for students.
You will need a student_export.text file from PowerSchool with at least the following information:
     ClassOf, FirstLast, Student_Number

The order of the CSV does not matter, but the headers must be on the very first line.
You will also need Google File Stream installed and configured
File Stream can be downloaded here: https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7329379?hl=en
